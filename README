This project is a fork of bitaddress.org, the original trustworthy
JavaScript powered offline bitcoin address generator. 

This attractive paper wallet design is two-sided and folds up to
hide the private key. Optional tamper-evident hologram tape can be purchased
to provide extra security against snooping. This generator is ONLY
for generating secure paper wallets, either using Javascript-based cryptography
or by supplying keys you have generated using your own means (e.g. vanitygen)

Use bitaddress.org if you need BIP38, brain wallets, or bulk addresses.

*** HOW TO USE THIS GENERATOR ***

1) Extract the ZIP file
2) Open up the 'generate-wallet.html' file with your web browser. 
3) If you like you can select a different language or holiday theme
4) Follow the steps for calibrating your printer and then printing
   the front and back of each wallet. Use landscape mode when printing!
   
Rendering and printing seems to work best using: 

   OS X:     Safari or Chrome or Firefox
   Windows:  Chrome or Firefox
   Linux:    Firefox

When using Chrome on Windows, use the Chrome print dialog. Switching to the
Windows system print dialog will cause corrupted output.


*** COMPARED WITH BITADDRESS.ORG ***

Images and resources have been moved out of the .html file (where they were
base-64 encoded) and into an images directory to make the code easier to review.

All cryptographic functions are verifiably identical to those in bitaddress.org.
(Run a "diff" between this project and bitaddress.org if you want to be sure.)

You can also bypass the random key generator and supply your own keys or so-called
"vanity addresses".


*** HOW TO VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS DOWNLOAD ***

After downloading the ZIP package for this generator, you should find a file 
named generate-wallet.html.sig which you can use to:

* Verify that generate-wallet.html hasn't been tampered with, and
* Get proof that it really was authored by Canton Becker (canton@gmail.com) 
  whose GPG public key and fingerprint should be confirmed at http://cantonbecker.com
  
For example, if you have GPG installed, you should be able cd to the appropriate 
directory and type in these two commands:

  gpg --recv-key 36E1D9B6
  gpg --verify --with-fingerprint generate-wallet.html.sig generate-wallet.html 

And then verify the resulting signature's fingerprint against Canton Becker's
published fingerprint at http://cantonbecker.com

If you get warnings like "This key is not certified, there is no indication that
the key belongs to the owner" do not worry, this is normal.

Now Bitcoin addresses and their corresponding private key can be conveniently 
generated in a web browser.

The bitaddress.org project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded
JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no
XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the 
JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being 
loaded. 

Here is a link to the BitcoinTalk.org forum topic discussing this project:

END USER NOTES: 
 1) To print QRCode in IE8 you must enable the "Print Background Colors and 
    Images" checkbox on the "Page Setup" screen.
 2) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.
 3) Requires IE8+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.
 4) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.
 5) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore
    they might record the private key you generated.
 6) Art Wallet does not work properly in IE8 due to CSS limitations.
