END USER NOTES: 
 1) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.
 2) Requires IE9+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.
 3) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.
 4) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore
    they might record the private key you generated.
 5) BIP38 most likely will not work on mobile devices due to hardware limitations.

Here is a signed list of file names and version history.

 -DO NOT USE VERSION 0.1 TO 0.4! They infrequently could generate bad keys.
 -Bug Fixed: v0.1 to v0.4 included a bug in the Elliptic Curve function:
   ec.PointFp.prototype.getEncoded
   The X and Y integers that were less than 32 bytes were not being zero padded.
   They are now zero padded which fixes the bug in generating public keys.
 -Bug Fixed: v0.3 and v0.4 had a bug in the Wallet Import Format function:
   ECKey.prototype.getBitcoinWalletImportFormat
   Private keys there were less than 32 bytes were not being zero padded.
   They are now zero padded which fixes the bug in generating private keys.
 -Requires IE8+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.
 -Added function to build a CSV list of addresses and keys. 
   Not supported in the GUI yet.
 -Added a timeout to override the mouse move detection. Therefore, if the user 
   has not moved his mouse before a certain random expiry the address and key
   will then be generated. This helps for mobile devices.
